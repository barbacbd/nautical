# Contributing

If you are aiming to become the first mate, second mate, deck cadet, engineer, or scallywag you have found your
way to the contributions documentation. Please continue reading if you would like to contribute or just follow along with the
development progress of the package.

- Ensure your system meets the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
- Fork the repository
- Follow the [Casting Off](#casting-off) section above
- Install the build dependencies, see [building and testing](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/blob/master/README.md).
- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!

## Contribution Flow

Anyone may submit [issues](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/issues). In fact, it is encouraged that users submit issues to contribute to the success and improvement of the project.
The issues will be reviewed by the captain, and given the proper tags to assist developers. Shipmates that would like to work on pull requests, the workflow is roughly:

1. Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
2. Make commits of logical units.
3. Make commit messages that clearly document the changes.
4. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
5. Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
6. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

## Suggested Commit Message Format

A rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two
questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and
the body of the commit should describe the why.

Example:

```

noaa: Added XXX functionality to XXXX

** Added the XXX function to XXX to satisfy the need/
requirement for XXX.

** Additional information followed in other bullet points.

```

**Note**: _It is suggested (but not required) to add the Issue number to the commit message._
