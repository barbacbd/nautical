# Description

Ahoy! Whether you've got your sea legs under yeh', or you're just looking to get those toes wet, you have discovered Nautical. Nautical is a web scraper that allows its users to parse real time data from [NOAA's](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) buoys. You can try Nautical as a python or GO package! Nautical was created for research and data logging purposes, but there are many more possibilities for users to discover. 


If you would like to view the python documentation follow the [link to nautical's python documentation](https://barbacbd.github.io/nautical/build/html/index.html). 

If you would like to view the GO documentation follow the [link to nautical's GO documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/barbacbd/nautical).

# Features

The following are a set of features and/or data that can be accessed via the package. 

## Sources

A source is a group of buoys. The source can be thought of as a sponsor or owner of the group/set of buoys. The source may be used as an indicator of the type of data that is stored in a buoy object. 

**Note**: The `TAO` and `Tsunami` sources are not available in any regard.


## Buoys

A buoy _may_ contain, but are not limitted to, any of the following variables.

| Data | Abbreviation |Units |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Wind Speed | wspd | Knots |
| Gust | gst | Knots |
| Wave Height | wvht | Feet |
| Dominant Wave Period | dpd | Seconds |
| Average Wave Period | apd | Seconds |
| Pressure | pres | PSI |
| Pressure Tendency | ptdy | PSI |
| Air Temperature | atmp | Fahrenheit |
| Water Temperature | wtmp | Fahrenheit |
| Dew Point | dewp | Fahrenheigt |
| Salinity | sal | PSU |
| Visibility | vis | Nautical Miles |
| Tide | tide | Feet |
| Swell Height | swh | Feet |
| Swell Wave Period | swp | Seconds |
| Wind Wave Height | wwh | Feet |
| Wind Wave Period | wwp | Seconds |
| Ocean Temperature | otmp | Fahrenheit |
| Wind Speed 10m Interval | wspd10m | Knots |
| Wind Speed 20m Interval | wspd10m | Knots |
| Depth | depth | Feet |

## Data Caching

The cache can be used to save and load information about buoys and sources. The feature enables users to locally store and retrieve older information. NOAA refreshes the online data roughly every 30 minutes. The cache package can be used to throttle data retrieval calls to ensure the user is not wasting system resources when data has not been updated by NOAA.

- Create cache files
- Copy cache files to new names (with timestamps or custom names)
- Load Cache files to Nautical Objects.

**Note**: _[Nautical cache](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/blob/master/nautical/cache/) was added in version 3.1.0_.

# Prerequisites 

The python package requires `python>=3.6`. You can use a package manager to install a version of python that satifies the requirements, or you may manually install python from the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
<br>
<br>
The GO package requires `golang>=1.18`. To install go please visit the official [website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

**Note**: _The GO requirement is not strict, but previous versions have Not been tested_.

# Casting Off

- Ensure your system meets the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
- Clone or Fork the repository.
- Run the [package tests](#testing)

# Tutorials

Follow the link to view the [tutorials for the python package](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/blob/master/user/docs/PythonTutorials.md).

Follow the link to view the [tutorials for the go package](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/blob/master/user/docs/GoTutorials.md).

# Testing

## Python 

All python tests are located in the [tests](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/tree/master/tests) directory.

```bash
python 3.x -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
pytest --cov=tests
```

**Note**: _The virtual environment and coverage are optional_.

## GO

All golang tests are located with the golang source in [pkg](https://github.com/barbacbd/nautical/tree/master/pkg). The following should be executed from the project home directory.

```bash
go get -u
go test -v ./...
```
