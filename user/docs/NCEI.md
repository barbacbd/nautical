# NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information

The NCEI module was added to version 2.3.0 found [here](../../nautical.noaa.ncei). The module adds a NOAA-managed [API](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) that provides users environmental information.
Further reading about the API information can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted).

A token is required to access the information provided by the API, and tokens are limitted to 5 requests per second or 10,000 per day. A default token has been provided with this package, but
it is **highly** recommended that each skallywag create their own [token](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token). It is a free process that is completed before you can walk the plank!
